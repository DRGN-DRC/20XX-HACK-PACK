The primary point of interest here is the Code Library (the "20XXHP 5.0 Code Library" folder), which allows you to customize the code in 20XX. For downloads of the patch for the whole mod (including character costumes, stages, etc.), see the OP in the official thread linked above.

![Usage](/imgs/Usage.png)

To install new custom code to 20XX, you need the latest build of [MCM (The Melee Code Manager)](https://smashboards.com/threads/melee-code-manager-v4-4-easily-add-mods-to-your-game.416437/). To begin, download that and the Code Library from this repo, and unzip them both. You also need a vanilla NTSC 1.02 DOL (you'll need to obtain this on your own).

1. Open MCM
2. Click on the Mod Library Select button in the top-right (books icon)
3. Click "Add Another Library Path", and navigate to where you saved the 20XX Code Library
4. Once you've added the new library, it should be selected by default. Click Ok to close the window
5. Once the new library has loaded, use the "Open" button or drag-and-drop your vanilla DOL onto the program
7. Click the "Code-Space Options" button, and enable the "20XXHP 5.0 Regions" for use, and close the window
8. Hold Shift and Click "Select All"; this will select all of the codes in the library to install
9. Click "Save As..." to create a new DOL file, so you don't overwrite your vanilla copy

MCM and the current Code Library for 20XXHP v5.0 should build a dol with this hash: 18d1f48a8bf0473e14309e1b654c9fd3
