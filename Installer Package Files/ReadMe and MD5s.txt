	==========
	  Step 1
	==========

Download and extract the .zip file to some directory on your machine.


	==========
	  Step 2
	==========

To create a copy of 20XX, you need to have a vanilla (original/unmodified) 
NTSC version 1.02 copy of Melee. This is copyrighted, so you'll have to get this on your own! 

If you don't know what version your vanilla ISO is, or need to convert it to a different version, see here: 
http://smashboards.com/threads/ssbm-version-converter-patcher-32-bit-beta-released.295223/page-2#post-20195941

Or if you have a Vimms disc, you may be able to convert it back to the original disc using the method here:

	==========
	  Step 3
	==========

		For Windows:
		------------

Simply drag-and-drop your Vanilla 1.02 Melee ISO onto the "SSBM_20XXHP_Creator.bat" file.

Done!


Or you can use the following command:

	"SSBM_20XXHP_Creator.bat" [sourceDisc] 	

You'll need to replace [sourceDisc] with the path/filename to your vanilla source disc.


		For Linux:
		----------

Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

	cd /to/the/directory/with/your/script
	chmod a+rx SSBM_20XXHP_Creator.sh
	./SSBM_20XXHP_Creator.sh "dir/ssbm_1.02.iso"

In the commands above, you'll need to replace "/to/the/directory/with/your/script" with the 
path to your script, and "dir/ssbm_1.02.iso" to the path/filename of your source disc.


		For Mac:
		--------

You can use a small program to apply the patch instead, found here:
