  Step 1)

Download and extract the .zip file to some directory on your machine.


  Step 2)

To create your copy of 20XX, you need to start with a vanilla (original/unmodified) version 1.02 copy of Melee.

If you don't know what version your vanilla ISO is, or need to convert it to a different version, see here: 
http://smashboards.com/threads/ssbm-version-converter-patcher-32-bit-beta-released.295223/page-2#post-20195941



	For Windows: 

Simply drag-and-drop your Vanilla 1.02 Melee ISO onto the "SSBM 20XXHP 5.0 Creator.bat" file.

Done!


	For Mac or Linux:

Open a Terminal and run these commands:

	sudo apt install xdelta3
	cd /to/the/directory/with/your/script
	chmod a+rx script_file.sh
	./script_file.sh dir/ssbm_1.02.iso

You'll need to rename "script_file.sh" and "ssbm_1.02.iso" in the commands above to match the name of the script in your download, and the path + filename of your vanilla ISO.




	Alternate method for Mac:

You can use a small program to apply the patch instead, found here:
