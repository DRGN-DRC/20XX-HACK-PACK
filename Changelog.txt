	- Slight alignment improvements to CSS's closed-port doors w/respect to CSPs***
	- Updated the disc's Image Name and Short/Long Titles (useful for game launcher identification)

	- You can now press L+R+A+Start to restart the game after crashes

	- Fixed a bug in the stage swap code for loading random [non-neutral] stages
	- Fix added for a Debug Menu bug in the "VS. Melee Player Flags" text (thanks to UnclePunch)

** The new alt. music has a 15% chance to play. Or any player may hold L on stage load to force it to play. The affected stages are Princess Peach's Castle, Rainbow Cruise, Kongo Jungle, Jungle Japes, Green Greens, Corneria, Venom, Flat Zone, Brinstar, Brinstar Depths, Fourside, Mute City, PokeFloats, Dreamland 64, Yoshi's Island 64, and Kongo Jungle 64. Note that playlists will take priority for any stage that uses one.
*** Character Select Portraits (CSPs) were previously slightly visible behind the closed port doors when a player port was turned off.

† I've documented exactly which character costumes and stages have been changed or added in the "20XXHP Costume List.xls" file, which you can find in this GitHub repo.

From Beta04:
 - n/a


From Beta03:

 - Stability improvements!
	 - Diagnosed and rewrote multiple codes that were causing freezes and other abnormalities.
 - Fixed a bug where opponents from the "Team [character name]!" match, in Classic Mode, would not spawn.
 - Fixed multiple other bugs related to 1P modes. They should be playable now.
 - Fixed a bug where freezing would occur when opening the Debug Menu and navigating 
   straight to CSS CODES --> CUSTOM METAL COLORS --> RGB COLOR VIEWER.
 - Fixed a bug where Mario's up+b walljump technique became easier on hacked stages with long, 90 degree 
   vertical ledge walls that include custom collision link flags.
 - Fixed a bug where Jungle Japes water textures would not get initialized in 1P modes, if the 
   Hacked Stage Select Screen was active in VS Mode.
 - Icicle Mountain being defaulted to fixed camera mode is restored.
 - "Zoom" camera mode in Training Mode now functions correctly.
 - Hyrule Castle 64 floors are now completely flat instead of very slightly angled.
 - Ice Climbers no longer entry spawn directly on top of each other.
 - Rewrote the "D-Pad Down at CSS for Rumble Screen" code. Should be stable now.


 - Added the Beta version number on the Debug Menu main menu.
 - Added stage name text previews for the [competitive] Hacked Stage Select Screen.
 - Added the hacked stage names to the Random Stage Select Screen, when applicable.
 - Changed the internal filename of the memory card save file. This means the 20XX 4.0 save file will 
   no longer overwrite vanilla Melee save files (and can coexist with a memory card exploit file such 
   as 20XX TE). GALE01 is still the Game ID, and will need to stay this way for upcoming planned features.
 - With Skip Results Screen enabled and in Stock Mode, the opponent of the player who ragequit is awarded 
   a KO star (Games won star).
 - Added an option to completely disable music, allowing the game to be played with no music and no SFX 
   without adjusting the TV volume.
 - Added a "Global" music playlist option that, when enabled, is used for any music played throughout the game.
 - Added the ability to specify custom x-axis DI strength for CPUs being upthrown, and attacks that put a 
   character into DamageFlyTop.
 - Added a toggle for SFX on successful Auto-Cancel.
 - Added the 20XX 3.02 feature for pressing Z while hovering over specific characters at the CSS to 
   enable Extra Characters.
	 - Peach = Female Wireframe
	 - C. Falcon = Male Wireframe
	 - Bowser = Giga-Bowser
	 - Ice Climbers = Popo
	 - Zelda = Sheik
	 - Pichu = Masterhand
	 - Pikachu = Crazyhand
 - CPU Sheik and Zelda do not Down+B transform ever. Use the extra character toggle mentioned above to 
   fight against Sheik.
 - Changed SD Remix Ganondorf from version 3.1 to version 3.2.1.
 - Extended Name Entry code has received a large rewrite and update thanks to Dan Salvato. Misalignment 
   and display issues with symbols have been fixed.
	 - Part of the new code is disabling the rumble flag for specific name tags. 
	   Rumble is now only set for the port and is not available for name tags.
	 - Even more symbols have been added to the Name Entry screen, combined with the 
	   feature "Press X for lowercase".


From Beta02:
- New Feature: Debug Menu --> Character Select Screen Codes --> Custom CSS Colors (screenshots)
- Bug FIx: Debug Menu --> pressing Start when two submenus deep does not load the victory screen and softlock the game.
- Bug Fix: Battlefield rainbow water BG toggle turned to OFF no longer loads Custom Battlefield 2 collision points.
- Bug Fix: v1.00 SDI/Hitlag code updated (thanks to new code from Magus posted today).
- Bug Fix: Widescreen toggle value is now applied immediately upon boot and no longer needs to experience a loading cycle first.
- Bug Fix: "Out-of-camera" magnifier bubbles in Widescreen mode now extend further to the sides of the screen (thanks to Dan Salvato).
- Bug Fix: Opening the Debug Menu and going directly to Stage Codes --> Custom FD Color --> RGB Color Viewer, no longer freezes the game. I also added in a text line to state that Rainbow FD takes priority.?

- Fixed GrNKr.1at & GrNKr.2at
