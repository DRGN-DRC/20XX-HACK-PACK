 (Aux Code Regions restored to vanilla code)

	Notes on Achilles' notes:


"Memory Card Names": code change should be 5375 -> 5858


Bowser Flame Cancel: note says change is at 0x135686 in RAM, but it should be 0x135684


SpawnPointCoords struct in the custom spawns table at 0x3FAAF0 is unused.

	Questions:


What is the value at the end of the DOL file for? (Appears to be file size, but is 0x10 smaller)


"Debug Menu Replaces Tournament Mode" is slightly different than the usual mod?


"Unlock All Characters & Stages & Random Stage Select" partially redundant with "Unlock All-Star Mode, Random Select, Sound Test, Score Display, and Every Special Message"?
author of former?


Unlock Stage Select Upon Boot		< Not added, in lue of other codes to do this (problem?)
0x15ba28 ---- 8803186c -> 3800000e


Does anything besides Chess Melee use "Rebirth All Active Players"? (these were not in the same mod originally) Why else would it be a static overwrite?


NBA Jam uses some flags, reserved as static overwrites in the mod "Misc. Flags". These should be moved to the NBA Jam mod. But how many bytes are required?


Why are there 4 [identical] variations of the SdMenu.usd file? Perhaps future use of multiple Special Melee menus?
